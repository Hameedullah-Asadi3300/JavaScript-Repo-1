   ##  Description

   ##  Comments
      This very small project is about types of comments and how to comment code in JavaScript.

   ##   Strings
      This project contains all of the following aspects of string data type:
   Syntax, escaping characters, escape sequences like \", \', \n, \t, \r, \b\, concatenation, .length property, and immutability.

   ## Basic Math
      This projects includes all mathematical operations in JavaScript. Worked with arithmethic and assignment opertaors.

   ## Variable Data Type
      This project allowed me to work on all the methods of variable declaration and values intialization.
      var         Is accessible anywhere in the code
      let         Is accessible within the scope declared 
      const       Is used for values which are fixed and not muteable

   ## Array
      In this project I have worked on arrays in JavaScript, syntax, modifying the elements of arrays using the index, functions of arrays like:
      push, pop, shift, and unshift, and nested array/dimensional array.

   ## Functions
      In this little project, I have worked on functions in JavaScript, concatenation, conditional statement of if and else if inside the function
      and return statement with number and string data types whithin the functions.
