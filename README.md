   ##  Description

   ##  Comments
      This very small project is about types of comments and how to comment code in JavaScript.

   ##   Strings
      This project contains all of the following aspects of string data type:
   Syntax, escaping characters, escape sequences like \", \', \n, \t, \r, \b\, concatenation,
   .length property, and immutability.

   ## Basic Math
      This projects includes all mathematical operations in JavaScript. Worked with 
      arithmethic and assignment opertaors. I also worked on math.random/generates
      radnsom decimal and ParseInt/converts string to int functions.

   ## Variable Data Type
      This project allowed me to work on all the methods of variable declaration and values intialization.
      var         Is accessible anywhere in the code
      let         Is accessible within the scope declared 
      const       Is used for values which are fixed and not muteable

   ## Array
      In this project I have worked on arrays in JavaScript, syntax, modifying the elements
      of arrays using the index, functions of arrays like:
      push, pop, shift, and unshift, and nested array/dimensional array.

   ## Functions
      In this little project, I have worked on functions in JavaScript, concatenation, 
      conditional statement of if and else if inside the function
      and return statement with number and string data types whithin the functions.
      I also worked on how a function returns a value and how a function acceps a single and 
      multiple values.
      This project also includes function expression.

   ## Booleans and conditional statements
      In this project, I have worked on followings:
      a. booleans
      b. conditional statement - if, else if, and else statements and chain of if, else if, and else statements
      c. all comparison operators like: ==, ===, >, <, >=, <=, !=, !==,
      d. logical operators: !, &&, and ||

   ## Switch Statements
      This JavaScript project contains switch statement with default option, and multiple indetical options
      used as cases to return the same value.
      
   ## Object
      Inside this project, I have worked on how to create an object, nested objects, how to access to
      properties inside the object and nested objects,
      how to remove a property from an object, and how to add property and value using both dot and bracket notations.

   ## Loop
      In this .js file, I have worked on all three types of loops, for, while and do while loop.
      It also includes anested loop.

   ## Template Literals
      This project actually allow me to know the basic and fundamental philosophy behind the Template literals.
      In this project, I also worked on placing the variables inside the string using `backtick` characters.

   ## Method
      In this project I have worked on the syntax for method within an object.

   ## this Keyword
      In this little project, I have worked on this keyword, its usage and its function with objects.

   ## Object Constructor Function
      In this project, I have worked on how to create an object constructor function to use it as a blueprint
      for other objects.

   ## For of and For in Loop
      In this project, I have worked on "for of loop" and "for in loop" within array.

   ## Break, Continue and Labels
      This project contains practical examples of break used within switches and loops. It also contains examples of
      continue statements and JavaScript labels.

   ## Set
      This file contains JavaScript set and it's methods:
            1. add         | Added the values using the variables
            2. values      | Iterates the values in a set
            3. size        | Returns the size of a set in number
            4. deletes     | Removes the vaues by passing the value itself, not the index
            5. has         | Returns if the value exits or not with "true" and "false"
      
   ## TypeOf
      Typeof.js contains practical examples of all data types that can be hold in JavaScript Variables.
