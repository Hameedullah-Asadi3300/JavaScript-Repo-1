    <!--Spread operator is a part of ES6 introduced in 2015.
        The spread operator actually allows us to quickly copy all or part of existing array or object
        into another array or object.
        It is mostly used with combination to the array as well. 
    -->

const number1 = [100, 200, 300];
const number2 = [400, 500, 600];
const combination = [...number1, ...number2];
document.write(combination);
/*
It will return:
100,200,300,400,500,600

//  In the following line, we assigned the 1 and 2 to the variables one, and two and the rest to the array named restInArray
const [one, two, three, ...restInArray] = myNumbers;
