            //  There are 3 ways we can declare variable:
            var myName = "Hameedullah Asadi";   //Used anywhere in the program
            let myProfession = "Coding";        //Used only within the scope it is declared
            const addition = 2 + 2;               //Never changes
            console.log(addition);  //  The result is 4
            
            //  Assign value with the equal sign
            var num1;           //  Here we only declared a variable, but not assigned any value to it
            console.log(num1);  //  The result is undefined          
            var num2 = 10;      //  Here we declared and assigned a value
            console.log(num2);
            num1 = 15;          //  Here we assigned a value to num1, but did not declare here, because it has beed already declared
            console.log(num1);  //  The result is 15

            num1 = num2;        //  Here we assigned the value of num1 to num2
            console.log(num1);  //  Here we run the value for num1 to the browser
